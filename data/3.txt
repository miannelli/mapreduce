   This  Pain killer and alcohol can make a  lethal  combination: 
says the Mayo Clinic's newsletter.

    Acetaminophen  has  become a popular drug,  especially  since 
1955  when it first became available without prescription in  the 
United  States.  It  is  best known in  America  by  the  heavily 
advertised  brand names Tylenol and Datril.  Nevertheless,  it is 
present either alone or in a combination with other drugs in more 
than  200  over-the-counter formulations promoted for  relief  of 
pain, cough and colds. 

    In equivalent dosage,  acetaminophen is just as effective  as 
aspirin in relieving mild pain and reducing fever. In contrast to 
aspirin,  acetaminophen  does not irritate the stomach lining  or 
interfere  with  the  role  of  blood  platelets  in  controlling 
bleeding  from  small  blood  vessels.  Also,  it  has  not  been 
associated with Reye's syndrome. For these reasons, this drug has 
been  heavily  promoted  as a safe aspirin  substitute.           

     When  taken  in  recommended  amounts,  acetaminophen  is  a 
remarkably  safe medication.  Yet,  if ingested in large  amounts 
(for example,  either inadvertently or in a suicide attempt, this 
drug  can  cause  severe liver and kidney  damage.  Until  recent 
years,  acetaminophen poisoning has been infrequently  recognized 
in  America.  In contrast,  for reasons that are unclear,  deaths 
from overdosage often have been reported from the United  Kingdom 
(where the drug is called paracetamol).
